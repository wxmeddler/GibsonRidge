# Gibson Ridge Repository
Color Tables / UDP's and Placefiles for Gibson Ridge Radar and Weather Software Products (http://grlevelx.com/). Color Tables are sourced from various places. Most I have made myself but were extracted manually from other color tables on the web. In the indivudual file there usually is a source for the origional source.
